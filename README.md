# ngcontainer

In Angular, the ng-container is a structural directive that allows you to group multiple elements together without introducing an additional HTML element in the rendered output. It's mainly used for structural purposes and doesn't create any DOM elements itself. Here's how it works:

## Grouping Elements
You can use ng-container to group multiple elements together, such as div, span, or any other HTML elements. This grouping is helpful when you want to apply structural directives like *ngIf or *ngFor to multiple elements at once.

```typescript
<ng-container *ngIf="condition">
  <div>Content 1</div>
  <div>Content 2</div>
  <div>Content 3</div>
</ng-container>
```

In the example above, if the condition is true, all the <div> elements will be rendered as a group. If the condition is false, none of the elements will be rendered. The ng-container itself doesn't create any DOM element.

## Multiple Structural Directives 
You can also use ng-container to apply multiple structural directives to a single container without introducing extra elements.

```typescript
<ng-container *ngIf="condition1; else elseBlock">
  <div>Content 1</div>
  <div>Content 2</div>
</ng-container>

<ng-template #elseBlock>
  <div>Alternate Content</div>
</ng-template>
```
  
In this example, if condition1 is true, the div elements inside the ng-container will be rendered. If condition1 is false, the elseBlock template will be rendered instead. The ng-container acts as a container for the structural directive and allows you to apply the *ngIf directive to a group of elements.

## Iterating with *ngFor
ng-container can also be used with the *ngFor directive to iterate over a collection and render multiple elements.

```typescript
<ng-container *ngFor="let item of items">
  <div>{{ item }}</div>
</ng-container>
```

In this example, each item in the items collection will be rendered as a separate div element. The ng-container acts as a container for the repeated elements.

The main advantage of using <ng-container> is that it allows you to apply structural directives to multiple elements without introducing extra HTML elements in the DOM structure. It helps keep the HTML clean and avoids unnecessary wrapper elements.

Remember that ng-container itself doesn't create any visible output. Its purpose is solely for grouping elements and applying structural directives.
